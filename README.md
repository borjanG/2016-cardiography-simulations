# HeartAttack

TD1 :

-Setup of a Git/Github repository
-Reading/Comprehension of the minimal model
-Discretization of the model using the finite differences method with the Euler explicit method

TD2 :

-Implementation and plotting of the minimal model functions (c.f. https://github.com/tguegan/HeartAttack/commit/4cf0d0738e94c520db184519d0d9d3825eb4ce73)

TD3 :

-Discretization of the minimal model taking into consideration of boundary conditions
-Test with the fonction u = cos(k1*Pi*x)*cos(k2*Pi*y) : error not small enough ==> wrong matrix

TD4 :

-Correction of the matrix
-Correction of the second member
-Test with the fonction u = cos(k1*Pi*x)*cos(k2*Pi*y) : error ok decrease at a O(h^2) rate
