# HeartAttack

TD1 :

-Setup of a Git/Github repository
-Reading/Comprehension of the minimal model
-Discretization of the model using the finite differences method with the Euler explicit method

TD2 :

-Implementation and plotting of the minimal model functions without the laplacian

TD3 :

-Discretization of the minimal model taking into consideration of boundary conditions

-Test with the fonction u = cos(k1Pix)cos(k2*Piy) : error not small enough ==> wrong matrix

TD4 :

-Correction of the matrix

-Correction of the second member

-Test with the fonction u = cos(k1ix)cos(k2Piy) : error ok decrease at a O(h^2) rate
